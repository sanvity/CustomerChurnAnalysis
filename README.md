***Core Churn Drivers***

A. Contract Type & Tenure
Month-to-month customers churn the most, especially within the first 1–3 months.
Long-term contracts show structurally lower churn, confirming commitment duration reduces exit probability.
Insight: Churn is fundamentally an early-lifecycle failure.

B. Service Type (Fiber Optic Risk Segment)
Fiber users churn more than DSL users, despite higher ARPU.
Indicates expectation–delivery mismatch rather than pure price sensitivity.
Likely causes: reliability issues, onboarding gaps, or poor support escalation.

C. Value Perception via Bundling
Customers without add-on services (security, backup, tech support) churn at higher rates.
Bundled users exhibit lower churn due to higher perceived value and switching costs.
Insight: Retention improves when the product feels “complete.”

D. Payment Method as Commitment Signal
Electronic check users churn significantly more than auto-pay or card users.
Payment behavior reflects customer intent and engagement, not just convenience.
